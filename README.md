## Practical Test: React.js API Integration

### Task Overview
Create a React application that fetches data from a mock API and displays it in a paginated list.

### Requirements

1. **API Endpoint:**
   - Use the following mock API endpoint for fetching data: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`

2. **Paginated List Display:**
   - Fetch data from the API endpoint.
   - Display the fetched data in a paginated list, where each page shows a specified number of items.
   - Each list item should display the title and body of a post.

3. **Loading State:**
   - Implement a loading state to indicate that data is being fetched.
   - Show a loading indicator while data is being retrieved.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle any errors that may occur during the API request.
   - Display an error message if the data cannot be fetched.

5. **Styling:**
   - Style the paginated list and loading indicator for a clean and user-friendly interface (TS).

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
   - Properly structure your React components.
   - Use appropriate lifecycle methods and hooks.


### Note

- You may use any state management library or approach you are comfortable with (e.g., React Context, Redux).
- Ensure that the code is well-commented to explain the logic and any important decisions.
